## About The Project

This is a custom **ELF disassembler** built in **Python** using **pyelftools** and **Capstone**. It takes in an ELF binary, parses the `.text` section, and prints a human-readable disassembly of the machine code.

I started this project to deepen my understanding of reverse engineering and low-level binary analysis. It was also an opportunity to get hands-on experience with Capstone and pyelftools, two powerful libraries often used in reverse engineering workflows.

*While disassemblers already exist, I built this from scratch as a personal project to challenge myself and gain hands-on experience with the underlying concepts.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Virtualenv (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggbrooks/elf-disassembler.git
   cd elf-disassembler
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv disasm-env
   source disasm-env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
Run the disassembler script on an ELF binary:  
```bash
python disasm.py /path/to/your/elf_binary
```

Example output:  
```
Binary path is: /Users/giannabrooks/Documents/VMShared/test1
0x680: pop     rdi
0x681: and     al, 3
```

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic disassembly of `.text` section
- [ ] Add symbol resolution – Use pyelftools to read and display symbol names from `.symtab` or `.dynsym` if available
- [ ] Allow selective disassembly – Let users disassemble specific address ranges or functions
- [ ] Output to file – Support exporting disassembly to `.txt` or `.json` for analysis
- [ ] Disassemble additional sections – Handle `.plt`, `.init`, `.fini`, and `.got` entries
- [ ] Visualize control flow (optional) – Use networkx or Graphviz to generate a basic control flow graph (CFG)
- [ ] Add test ELF binaries and CI check – Keep a few sample binaries and test cases for future improvements
- [ ] Write a blog post or walkthrough

Progress will be tracked in the [Update Log](#update-log) section.
